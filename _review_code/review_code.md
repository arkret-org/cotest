# Regression Review

## 2026-07-22 release-gate baseline drift

Observed while verifying the target-aware Cotest scheduler at Cotest HEAD
`77e5f8ed3e99`. The scheduler executed all 27 configured release-gate tests;
the following failures are product/spec baseline regressions rather than test
selection failures.

### SDK reducer-profile digest is stale

- Severity: P0
- Evidence: `federation_replay_snapshot_and_redaction_contracts_work` receives
  `reducer_profile_mismatch` from Soland.
- Normative value: arkret-spec's current
  `reducer-profile-registry.json` and `federation-fixture.json` both pin
  `sha256:952a4c29fd910fa0f002602d983e621dfbd0b8bce085c8e0030a530290b92d72`.
- Stale generated value: arkret-rust-sdk
  `crates/policy/src/generated/profiles.rs` pins
  `sha256:fe7b320b94f96214842464efa9bdc9f99c54359a8bd9b98a18f24dde04f7426d`.
- Required resolution: regenerate and review the SDK profile constants from the
  current spec artifacts, then rebuild Soland. Do not change Cotest to the stale
  SDK value.

### Inkson mock parity omits Realm founding authority

- Severity: P1
- Evidence: `inkson_mock_contract_matches_live_soland_baseline` reports drift
  for `events_submit`, `realm_create`, `space_create`, directory search, and
  ephemeral behavior. Live writes fail with `realm_founding_grant_missing`.
- Normative source: `models/realm-and-space.md` section 2.5 requires
  `ak.realm.create` and its closed-form founding grant in one ordered batch.
- Required resolution: make the parity setup create the normative Realm
  bootstrap unit before comparing downstream event and ephemeral behavior.

### Morph migration fixture violates Realm actor-chain genesis

- Severity: P1
- Evidence: joint-smoke's additive morph migration receives
  `schema_violation`: `a Realm-scoped actor-chain genesis must use actor_seq=1`.
- Required resolution: derive the migration event's actor sequence and previous
  references from the live Realm actor frontier; a new Realm-scoped chain must
  begin at one.
