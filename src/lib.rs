//! `cotest` keeps the executable harness and scenario logic in the main crate.

// Doc-comment formatting in this crate uses heavily indented continuation
// lines, ASCII tables, and free-form bullet structures that pre-date
// clippy's CommonMark-strict lints. The substance is correct; reflowing
// hundreds of comments would create churn without changing behavior.
